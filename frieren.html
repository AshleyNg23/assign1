    <h2 class="story-header"> About the story </h2>
    <p class="story-body">During their decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King, the members of the hero's party—Himmel himself, the
      priest Heiter, the dwarf warrior Eisen, and the elven mage Frieren—forge bonds through adventures and battles,
      creating unforgettable precious memories for most of them.

      However, the time that Frieren spends with her comrades is equivalent to merely a fraction of her life, which has
      lasted over a thousand years. When the party disbands after their victory, Frieren casually returns to her "usual"
      routine of collecting spells across the continent. Due to her different sense of time, she seemingly holds no
      strong feelings toward the experiences she went through.

      As the years pass, Frieren gradually realizes how her days in the hero's party truly impacted her. Witnessing the
      deaths of two of her former companions, Frieren begins to regret having taken their presence for granted; she vows
      to better understand humans and create real personal connections. Although the story of that once memorable
      journey has long ended, a new tale is about to begin. </p>

        <h2 class="left-character-header">Frieren: The Elf Mage</h2>
        <p class="left-character-body"> Frieren was a mage in Hero Himmel's party. They travelled along with Priest Heiter and Warrior Eisen in a
          ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King. She was the last member to be recruited to the party and, despite
          Heiter's initial impression of her mana being average, Himmel had a hunch she was the most powerful mage he
          had ever met. She has a very apathetic personality despite living so long.</p>

        <h2 class="right-character-header">Fern: The Human Mage </h2>
        <p class="right-character-body"> Heiter's adopted daughter. After his death, she came under the care of Frieren. Fern grew up to be a strict
          and mature person beyond her age. Acts as a mother for the members of the squad. She constantly helps Frieren
          perform simple daily tasks, such as waking her up, dressing her, cooking. She behaves condescendingly with
          Stark, although they are about the same age, for example, scolds when he goes to bed late. Despite her outward
          steadfastness, Fern easily gets upset and can behave like a child if she is offended by something.</p>

          to put aside his fears in order to protect the people dear to him. He's much stronger than he thinks he is.
