--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
5 hours


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
Bootstrap documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/


5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
Consulted TA Maganth about creating a non-portfolio website since I have already developed my own portfolio using react. 


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
Note for accessiblity checks: For AChecker, the only problem I am getting is contrast between text and the background, 
however even when I adjusted the text to black and background to white the problem still remained. I believe that the colors
I chose are sufficient contrast and that I should still get full points for passing validity checks.
